# 📊 HR Attrition Analytics | Python & Power Bi

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs, productivity loss, and workforce instability.
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using HR data to identify key drivers behind employee turnover and support data-driven retention strategies.
The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide both high-level monitoring and root-cause insights.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to retain skilled employees when the underlying causes of attrition are not identified early.
The objective of this project is to analyze HR data to understand why employees leave or stay, focusing on factors such as job role, compensation, experience, overtime, job satisfaction,
promotions, and commute distance.
